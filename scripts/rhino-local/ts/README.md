# rhino-local mock-surface generator

Generates the **scripted-decision mock binding surface** from the captured AM
contexts metadata at `docs/api/bindings/scripted-decision-next.json`. This
package emits presence, not behaviour: every method throws
`rhino-local: not mocked: <binding>.<method> arity=N overload=[…]` until a
later slice implements it. A mock that returned `undefined` would turn a
missing feature into a passing test.

## Artefacts

Committed under `generated/`:

- `scripted-decision-mocks.cjs` — evaluated inside AM's Rhino as part of the
  script-under-test's scope
- `scripted-decision-mocks.d.ts` — TypeScript types for case authors

They are committed on purpose. Regenerating after Ping adds a method produces a
diff of the surface, which is the point of generating rather than hand-writing.

## Re-run

From this directory (Node 24):

```bash
npm install
npm run generate
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run lint:am
```

`npm run generate` reads the captured JSON (offline; it does not call the
tenant) and overwrites the two artefacts. Completeness tests fail if the
artefacts drift from the JSON, if a method is dropped, or if you forget to
regenerate after changing the emitter.

## The `.cjs` is AM-safe JavaScript

The generated mock is **not** Node. AM's Rhino 1.7.14 rejects or silently
miscompiles a large slice of ES2015; the rules are runtime-verified in
`docs/api/12-script-bindings-matrix.md` and encoded in
`src/scripts/templates/am/eslint.config.js`. The emitter stays inside that
subset:

- `var` at top level; **no `let`**; **no top-level `const`** (parses, then
  reads back `undefined` in a scripted-decision script)
- **no `for...of`**, object shorthand, destructuring, or default parameters
- **no `Map` / `Set` / `Symbol` / `Promise` / `WeakMap` / `WeakSet`**
- `function () { … arguments … }` for methods (no rest parameters)
- `const` _inside a function_ is allowed; this file just does not need it

`npm run lint:am` runs those Rhino rules over `generated/*.cjs`. The generator
itself is ordinary TypeScript and has no such limits.

## What the JSON does not name

Empty-`elements` bindings (`requestHeaders`, `requestParameters`,
`requestCookies`, `locales`) are emitted as `{}` — a seam a test case seeds
directly. Scalar bindings (`realm`, `scriptName`, `cookieName`) start as
`"__rhino-local-unseeded__"`; `resumedFromSuspend` starts as `false`.
